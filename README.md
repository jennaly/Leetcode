# Daily Leetcode
A repository of Leetcode challenges and varying solutions. All the attempts/solutions here pass Leetcode's test cases, but vary in their time and space complexity. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations

I consistently revisit solutions that I feel could be refactored and/or optimized. Occasionally there will be another solution/algorithm that performs better in both time and space complexity. Sometimes one solution could take less time than another (but takes up more space/memory), or vice versa.
## Lessons Learned:

From tackling these challenges I have cultivated a habit to constantly be thinking of possible edge cases.
